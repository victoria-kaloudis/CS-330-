How do I approach designing software?

My approach for this project and designing software was to take everything one step at a time. The first hurdle was setting up the visual studio project with the correct directories. Once that was done, moving onto learning the code for calling OpenGL functions and understanding how to create 3D objects using that code was next. For most of the assignments in this course, I focused on adding in the easiest objects first, and saving the harder ones for last. This gave me time to understand how to develop a cylinder by the end of the course. Using trigonometry, I was able to figure out how to render a cylinder. Using this approach, of giving myself more time to learn harder concepts is very helpful for other courses. I can take this with me for the rest of my undergraduate career.


How do I approach developing programs?

I mentioned above that learnign the code to call OpenGL functions was imperative to creating my 3D scene. Specifically, creating a new mesh for each object allowed me to give them different textures. Making sure the namespace, URender, and UCreateMesh functions had all of the appropriate components was key. For example, my second mesh was called Mesh2. I had to make sure the namespace had Mesh2 and the URender function called UCreateMesh2 function to render it. Then, I needed to make sure the textures were associated correctly with the appropriate Ids. Taking this project week by week with each milestone was very helpful for my learning. I was able to do an example on a different assignment, and then use that same code and apply it to my project. It made it easier to organize and essentially render the 3D objects. 



How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This project was very challenging for me. Especially trying to understand a cylinder. Once I took the math approach for the cylinder, it was much easier to render it for me. Applying trigonometric functions to the angles and calculating the points of the top and bottom spaces of a cylinder was much easier than taking the function approach with the code. I'm sure when I practice more, I will be successful in creating a vertex using a function to identify all of the points on my cylinder for rendering. The approach I took on this project will definitely help me with my future courses in the CS program. I will continue to develop my CS skills in future classes and can apply my knowledge from this project on other projects. This class has also given me tips on how to approach other 3D objects should I go into this area of CS after school. I also haven't worked with C++ in quite some time, so having the basic coding practice was nice and kept me up to date with the C++ language.
